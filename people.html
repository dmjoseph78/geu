            64 tribes
The ethnicity of South Sudan is richly diverse. There is 64 tribes or ethnic <br>groups are natives of the nascent nation. Many of these ethnic groups share common culture, <br>very closely-link cultural traits with intelligible languages which forming distinct larger family units.
<p>The Nuer and the Dinka, the two largest ethnic groups in the South, historically have primarily inhabited <br>Upper Nile and Bahr al-Ghazal. Both groups traditionally moved through each other's areas to water cattle<br> during migrations to and from swamp areas.31 Dec 2013

<p>South Sudan is incredibly diverse with over 60 different ethnic groups. Anthropologists have traditionally<br> categorised the peoples and tribes of South Sudan under six distinct groupings. The majority of the South<br> Sudanese population are defined as Nilotic, meaning their tribal origins trace back to the White Nile.</p>

    <h3>Families</h3>
    <p>Family is the most important aspect of life in South Sudan. “Family” can refer to an expansive kinship network, including the extended family and distant relatives, as well as the relatives of spouses that are married into the family. In this way, the organising principle of society is often based on a broad community of relationships rather than the nuclear family.

 

        Family Structure
        
        The basic household structure is traditionally large and multigenerational. People generally try to have as many children as possible, sometimes up to 20. South Sudanese living in other countries may seek to have smaller families due to the expense of raising multiple children; however, nuclear family units generally remain larger than what is standard throughout the English-speaking West. The extended family generally lives with the nuclear family, unless uncontrollable circumstances prevent this arrangement. Even in the situations where they cannot live together, all relatives usually live within close proximity of one another.
        
         
        
        Extended relatives expect to be able to rely on one another in times of need. For example, older family members are cared for by younger generations as they age. The decades of conflict have also left many people orphaned or widowed that are usually taken in and cared for by extended family networks. Considering the size of some families, they may make use of public spaces such as parks to congregate.</p>
        <p>Children typically live in their parents’ home until they are married, or even beyond that point. The age of marriage varies between tribes, sometimes occurring in one’s teenage years or later on in adulthood. It tends to happen later on in urban areas. However, most people aim to be married and settled with their partner by their mid-20s. Females usually move into their husband’s family’s home upon marriage. However, for men, it is common to have their wife move into their parents’ house with them. As such, the average South Sudanese household usually consists of three generations: (1) the eldest couple, (2) their sons, sons’ wives and any unmarried daughters, and (3) their grandchildren.

 

            Childcare is often shared among all adults within a family, or sometimes the community at large, as opposed to singular parents. Generally, any adult concerned can discipline a child. The use of corporal punishment is common. Despite the fact that many people play a part in raising Sudanese children, a child’s misbehaviour is generally considered to be a reflection of their parents alone. Error on their behalf brings shame on the family and its ancestors. In some tribes, women sleep in the same bed as their child until the child is around 7 years old while fathers sleep in a separate room.
            
             
            
            Gender Roles
            
            Gender roles are quite rigidly defined in South Sudan. It is expected that young girls follow their mother’s behaviour and boys learn from their father. The man is the breadwinner and the decision maker, while females are the house maker and child bearer. This also translates into a gender divide in tasks. Women generally grow the crops and complete the domestic chores, whilst men are encouraged to socialise and look after the family’s animals. However, the role of women has been broadening as many have been left widowed by the conflict and have had to take on tasks traditionally associated with men.</p>
            <p>South Sudanese society tends to be deeply patriarchal. The father or eldest man leads the family and holds the most authority. Family assets and inheritance are also passed down through the male line. On the other hand, a paternalistic attitude generally surrounds women. Parents are often particularly protective over their daughter’s safety and sexual propriety out of fear that she will do something to bring shame upon the family. This can mean that women have less freedom than their brothers and husbands to socialise in public, stay up late, etc. Part of the reason behind this attitude is that women are traditionally seen as sources of wealth. The custom of bride price attaches a monetary value to them at marriage (see more information on this in Marriage and Dating below). As such, the more wives or daughters a man has, the wealthier he is perceived to be. It shows he was rich enough to afford the dowry of one wife (or multiple wives) and will be receiving further wealth when his daughters are married off. 



                However, this perception of females is transforming as more women receive a formal education. NGOs and aid agencies have also put pressure on South Sudan to change women’s human rights treatment under customary law. Furthermore, many people change their ideas about the role of men and women upon moving to host countries (such as Australia). Living in these societies with increased empowerment often sees women exercise their social rights and power. Men can sometimes struggle adjusting to Western cultural family structures. Having solely understood their role as the provider and head of the house, the increased social power women and children gain can make some feel as if they have lost their manhood. Many may think that they are not fulfilling their social obligations as the family breadwinner if they have to rely on financial assistance, their wife earns more than them or they have to share childcare duties.
