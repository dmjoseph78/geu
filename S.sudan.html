                South Sudan (officially the Republic of South Sudan) is located in east-central Africa and is the most recently formed country in the world. It gained independence from North Sudan in 2011 after over 50 years of political struggle. Being the youngest country in the world, its national identity is still emerging. Most South Sudanese people share a cultural connection based on their common practice of Christianity, and the experience of struggle and liberation from North Sudan. However, the South Sudanese tend to feel more cultural affiliation and loyalty to their tribal and ethnic groups rather than allegiance to the nation. Furthermore, despite its recent secession, the country continues to face serious civil unrest and endemic violence. Almost two million people have been internally displaced since the outbreak of civil war in 2013.1 The cultural lives of many South Sudanese have been deeply altered by the effects of conflict. As the source of one of the world’s most enduring refugee populations, the experience of exile has also changed people’s practice of traditions. Nevertheless, the South Sudanese are renowned for being resilient, adaptable and flexible. Many continue to work through difficult situations with little complaint and are incredibly self-reliant and resourceful.

                South Sudan was settled by many of its current ethnic groups during the 15th–19th centuries. After the Sudan region was invaded in 1820 by Muḥammad ʿAlī, viceroy of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, the southern Sudan was plundered for slaves. By the end of the 19th century the Sudan was under British-Egyptian rule.

            <p>South Sudan is the world's youngest independent country. Established in 2011 after two wars, South Sudan has since reverted to a state of devastating civil strife. This book provides a general history of the new country, from the arrival of Turco-Egyptian explorers in Upper Nile, the turbulence of the Mahdist revolutionary period, the chaos of the 'Scramble for Africa', during which the South was prey to European and African adventurers and empire builders, to the Anglo-Egyptian colonial era. Special attention is paid to the period since Sudanese </p>

                independence in 1956, when Southern disaffection grew into outright war, from the 1960s to 1972, and from 1983 until the Comprehensive Peace of 2005, and to the transition to South Sudan's independence. The book concludes with coverage of events since then, which since December 2013 have assumed the character of civil war, and with insights into what the future might hold.
