           <h3>The South sudan Website</h3>
           <p>The South Sudan web site is a collaborative project between between Mr. Geu Achiek <br>and Maggie Center.It was created in 2021 as a web page where you can see, know and learn more about South Sudan/ South Sudanese.<br>It aims to inform and Educate public about importance of culture, history and people of South Sudan</p>
           <p>All published content in the Junub site is the result of a collective effort between researchers, editors and members of the Maggie <br>school community that have cross-cultural identities or familiarities. We would particularly like to acknowledge the contribution of many<br> of Kakuma multicultural community members, who took the time and effort to provide relevant information about their culture.


            By gathering<br> such knowledge into one resource, the Junub site provides a unique opportunity for users to gain a broad understanding of the norms and behaviour<br> that would generally be familiar to people from the culture of description. The cultural observations are contextualised with up-to-date statistics about <br>Kakuma migrant populations and information on their trends of arrival and settlement. At a personal level, we hope the Junub Site offers its users the<br> chance to inform their judgements of cross-cultural experiences with a deeper understanding.

            <h3>The Purpose of cultural Profile</h3>
            <p>Cultural profiles should not be relied upon to form expectations or stereotypes of an individual’s behaviour based on their country of origin. This information is purposed to give you an understanding of the dominant culture within a country so that you may gain insight into the kind of cultural and social environment a first-generation migrant from that country is likely to be familiar with.


                Please remember that descriptions of dominant cultures are not representative of all individuals and should not be strictly applied as such. Countries contain many microcultures that differ from the mainstream culture in identifying characteristics, and people’s behaviour varies on a personal basis. Furthermore, one's difference from the dominant culture of their country of origin can be a key reason for their migration. 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The information contained in the Cultural Atlas is most relevant for describing the cultural familiarities of first-generation migrants who were originally born in the country of the profile in question. As cultural tradition diverges and transforms with every generation, such information tends to be less representative of second-generation migrants. Although many features of societies are persistent, cultures continue to evolve. It is also important to note that those migrants who have been settled and acculturated in Australia for decades may have a different understanding of their country’s cultural and social climate from those living there today. This varies depending on how frequently they have visited the country since their migration as well as other factors. This resource can only provide a general guideline.
